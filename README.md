# Word-Guess-Game

This project demonstrates a hangman style game, using chess based words that the user must guess. It was an exercise in using javascript to create dynamic HTML based on user key input. I utilized 5 simple functions for making a guess, evaluating a guess, checking if you win, resetting the game, and updating the page. Alex Tyk maintains and contributes to the project.
