# Word-Guess-Game

This project demonstrates a hangman style game, using chess based words that the user must guess. It was an exercise in using javascript to create dynamic HTML based on user key input. There is one caveat about starting the game - I was unable to get it to work without introducing one automatic win at the beginning, so the win tabulation is slightly off.
